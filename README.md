# Mathematics formulary

### What this is

In this repo I will be building a mathematics formulary. The formulary will cover essential topics, rules and considerations when working with equations up to and including differential calculus, statistics and analysis.

### Why it started

The idea for a formulary started because I wanted my own handy reference, not just for the formulas, but also to have a single source to refer to. As a relative tyro and with lots of tests coming up it just made sense to have one. What the formulary is turning into is really revision in its own right as I progress in other areas of mathematics.

### What to expect

I am currently studying mathematics (full-time) as I work (full-time). This creates some limits on my rate of progress. However, this is an active project. In addition, I only want to include formulas and methods for topics I already understand.

For these reasons _and to keep me focused_ the outline below represents a tasklist (and statement of intent). As sections are written I'll include links to those sections in the outline. I will also keep this document up-to-date as things change.
