# Mathematics formulary

### What this is

This is a formulary and set of notes I am creating as part of my own mathematics study and revision. The formulary will cover essential topics, rules and considerations when working with equations up to and including differential equations, introductory linear algebra and statistics.

### Why it started

The idea for a formulary started with upcoming exams. I wanted a handy reference and everything I found had one of the following problems:

- It was too basic
- It was too advanced
- It was missing material
- Explanations were poor or did not exist

As a relative tyro and with tests coming up it just made sense to start writing my own.
### What to expect

I am studying (full-time) and working (full-time). This creates some limits on my free time. However, this is an active project, along with learning Python, Scilab, Stata and Maple, it is is important for me to complete it. 

I have therefore created the outline below as a personal guide (that I will keep updating. It can also be used as a draft content. I welcome comments and feedback, especially where it helps to improve the usability of the formulary, where I have made mistakes or where my understanding is improved.
