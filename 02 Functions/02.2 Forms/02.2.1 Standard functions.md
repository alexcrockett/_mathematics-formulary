With a grasp of what a function looks like we can now look at some basic forms function might come in. This is useful later when we want to look at a function that is maybe a little more complex and be able to analyze it.

### 2.2.1.1 Constant functions

These functions are surprisingly useful to be able to recognize, especially where you're working with differentiation. More on that later. They are also the easiest to recognize and use.

Constant functions as the name suggests, are functions with a constant value.

**Example 2.2.1.1.1**

$f(x) = c$ , $c\in R$

In other words for all inputs to the function, the function will always output $c$ where $c$ is some member of the set of real numbers.

**Example 2.2.1.1.2**

$f(x)=4$

**Plot 2.2.1.1.1**

```functionplot
---
title:
xLabel: x
yLabel: y = 4
bounds: [-7, 7, -2, 10]
disbaleZoom: 1
grid: true
---
f(x)= (4)
```

Here we can see exactly what this function is telling us. Whatever you put into it, -7 or 6 for the variable $x$, you will always get the same result. In this case 4.

### 2.2.1.2 Identity functions

As the name suggests, these are functions that behave like an identity between input and output. In other words the input always equals the output.

**Example 2.2.1.2.1**

$g(x)=x$

Because how this works may not be immediate apparent, simply replace $g(x)$ with $y$ and it will be obvious:

**Example 2.2.1.2.2**

$y=x$

**Plot 2.2.1.2.1**

```functionplot
---
title:
xLabel: x
yLabel: y = 4
bounds: [-7, 7, -2, 10]
disbaleZoom: 1
grid: true
---
f(x)= (x)
```

This function as can be seen has a particularly interesting property in that it cuts a line through the midpoint of the lower left and the upper right quadrants. In fact it does this in such a way that each of the following observations is true:

1. If you rotate the line about the origin twice you get the same function.
2. If you rotate about the origin once you would get the negative of the original function
3. the value of the slope is always 1, which as we start to look more closely at derivative we will see because the equation for this line is $y=mx+b \ = \ 1 \cdot x + 0$.
4. The angle from the $x$ or $y$ axis and the line is always $\pm  {45}^{\circ}$.

### 2.2.1.3 Linear functions

In fact the identity function is just a special case of a linear function, so called in part because of the straight line we get when we plot them graphically. In fact linear functions are entire class of functions and so we will only give enough depth here to move on. Linear functions will become increasingly important as we start to discuss Calculus, Vectors and Matrices where more information and formulas will be given.

We saw that the constant and identity functions produced a straight line. These functions have some common features. First (please forgive defining a feature with a negative), they don't have powers greater than 1. That is the highest power is equations is $x^1$.

Secondly, linear functions functions can be expressed in one of a number of ways depending on what we want to see. On the whole given in the following form:

**Example 2.2.1.3.1**

$f(x)=mx+b$

**In this formulation:**
- $m$ is the slope
- $x$ is our input value
- $b$ is the $y$ intercept

**Example 2.2.1.3.2**

$f(x) = 2x+3$

**Plot 2.2.1.3.1**

```functionplot
---
title:
xLabel: x
yLabel: y = 4
bounds: [-7, 7, -2, 10]
disbaleZoom: 1
grid: true
---
f(x)= (2x+3)
```

**Note the following features:**
1. The line crosses the y-axis at 3
2. For every increment in the $x$ direction we can see that the function value increases by 2

In other words the equation $mx+b$ captures very nicely important features of the line.

We might also find one of the following:

**Point-Slope Form:**

$y−y1​=m(x−x1​)$

Here if we know some point $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and the slope $m$ we can find the line.

**Standard form:**

$Ax+By=C$

In this form, $A, B, C$ are integers, and $A$ and $B$ are not both zero. This form is often used in systems of linear equations and for finding intercepts.

**Intercept Form**:

$\frac{x}{a}+\frac{x}{b}=1$

This form is used when the x-intercept (a) and the y-intercept (b) are known. It's particularly useful in geometry and graphical representations.

**Two-Point Form**:

$\frac{y-y_{1}}{y_{2}-y_{1}} = \frac{x-x_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$

This is used when you have two known points $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ on the line. It's a specific case of the point-slope form.

We will discuss some of these forms later when we review vectors.

Some important takeaways when looking at linear functions will

### 2.2.1.4 Absolute value functions

Absolute value functions are very good at showing how and why a function does what it does. For an absolute value function the output is always the absolute value of whatever computation is done.

**Example 2.2.1.4.1**

$f(x) = |x|$

Is an example of the simplest equation of this form.

**Plot 2.2.1.4.1**

```functionplot
---
title:
xLabel: x
yLabel: y = 4
bounds: [-7, 7, -2, 10]
disbaleZoom: 1
grid: true
---
f(x)= abs(x)
```

As we can see here the plot has an interesting property we'll see in the quadratic function that we saw in our review of notation; the function's output always has a positive value, irrespective of the input's sign. In other words, the function take the input and computes the output such that it is always positive.

It is a functions ability to *transform* an input into some other shape that makes it such a powerful tool, in fact machine learning and artificial intelligence rely on functions in this way.

In this example we can see that the function gives us, say for an input of $-2$, $y=2$ and so on. We can increase the complexity as much as we like, for which we can get some very interesting results.

**Example 2.2.1.4.2**

Let us contrast the absolute value of a function with the same function whose absolute value we don't take.

$f(x) = |x^3-20|$
$g(x) = x^3 - 20$
$h(x) = x^3$

**Plot 2.2.1.4.2**

```functionplot
---
title:
xLabel: x
yLabel: y = 4
bounds: [-25, 25, -25, 25]
disbaleZoom: 1
grid: true
---
f(x)= abs(x^3-20)
g(x)= (x^3-20)
h(x)= x^3
```

Only one of these functions has negative values. In this example $f(x)$ makes a sort of v shape with a kink in the left hand side at $y=20$, we can see this same kink going in the other direction for $g(x)$ at $y=-20$. We can see that the kink on either side of the equation occurs where $x=0$.

We have added $h(x)=x^3$ to provide contrast. Here we can see this same shifting across and between $y=-1$ and $y=1$, which makes sense when we consider what happens when we cube values between o and 1.

What's interesting from observing the absolute value function is how much a simple change to the function can change it's shape in such a radical way. We can see how a function takes in some value and applies the rules of the function to compute some new value.
Furthermore we can start to see how the shape of the output hinges on the structure of the function itself and how various rules relate to each other. As we start to look at function transformations we will see that these structural variations also have standard forms.

### 2.2.1.5 Quadratic functions

Quadratic functions are a part of a class of functions we will deal with extensively later. Here we are primarily concerned with the most basic form of the quadratic function.

**Example 2.2.1.5.1**

$f(x) = x^2$

**Plot 2.2.1.5.1**

```functionplot
---
title:
xLabel: x
yLabel: y = 4
bounds: [-10, 10, -5, 50]
disbaleZoom: 1
grid: true
---
f(x)= (x^2)
```

As we noted in section 2.1 we can see that this function does not produce any negative values of $y$. Because we multiple two negatives together for values $x>0$, we always end up with values of $y$ such that the upper left quadrant always mirrors the upper right quadrant. This gives the function the appearance of a curved version of the absolute value function (if we don't take the multiplication into account). It is the fundamental reason we see a parabola.

Quadratic functions introduce a new consideration into function equations that at first is not obvious, but later will become impossible to ignore. This consideration is the consideration of the highest power in the equation. When the highest power was $x^1$ there is no contrast to be made. Now that we have more than one power (what is in reality three degrees of power if we include $x^0$) it is worth observing what a highest power does to a function.

**Example 2.2.1.5.2**

$f(x)= x^2+2x+3$
$g(x) = (x^2)\cdot(2x+3)$
$h(x) = x^2\cdot \log(x)$

```functionplot
---
title:
xLabel: x
yLabel: y = 4
bounds: [-10, 10, -4, 10]
disbaleZoom: 1
grid: true
---
f(x)= (x^2+2x+3)
g(x) = (x^2)(2x+3)
h(x) = (x^2)(log(x))
```

Here we have three interesting functions in their own right, each demonstrating what can happen when we lead with a quadratic. Each shows in a different way the impact of the quadratic, or leading power on the rest of the function.

Let us start with $f(x) = ^+2x+3$.
